Dough
=====

Dough is a simple test puzzle game created using the XNA framework.  The game boils down to a few simple rules:
+  Blocks are cleared by getting four in a row vertically or horizontally.
+  There are two blocks falling at any one time, and they are independent of one another.
+  Blocks can be dropped faster by pressing the down key.
+  The blocks can be linked while falling and when adjacent by pressing the 'z' button.
+  Linked blocks can be rotated by pressing the 'x' button.
+  Pressing the up key will cause the current blocks to suspend in the air.
+  Blocks are added from the bottom at a rapid rate
+  If a block goes over the line, you lose.
+  If you meet the level objectives, you win.  For most levels, this means clearing all specially labelled blocks.

Overview
--------
Dough was developed as a simple test of procedural level generation and also as an example of a working XNA game.  Nearly all levels in Dough are random to some degree. The idea is that initially solving the puzzle will be the hard part, but they will still have enough variety to not be easy wins when the levels are replayed.  This does mean that sometimes luck will allow you to quickly clear a level, but this is the tradeoff that is made.

Development
-----------
Dough is not currently completed, and should be considered in the alpha phase of development.  It is currently playable, but all of the bugs are not yet worked out and there are new features yet to be added for the initial release.
